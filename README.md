# cohort8_structure

# Introduction
For the past 7 cohorts (since January 6th 2018), we have offered free machine learning classes to more than 1000 Nigerians and we are excited to continue our long-standing tradition. This document will serve as a guideline for our students, as well as other communities looking to replicate the AI Saturdays Lagos model ‚ù§Ô∏è. Each cohort has a different flavor, so do check out our [Cohort 7](./cohort7/README.md) guideline as well.

## What should I expect?
- 17 weeks of Main class and 1 week break üòé
- 10 practicals 
- 1 Main project
- Exercises to put your knowledge to test
- Certificate of participation if all the requirements are fulfiled (more details below)

## How can I access the classes?
Our classes are streamed weekly and can be accessed online, at anytime - for free!

- You are expected to have about 60% or more participation in Labs. Participation will be monitored by taking attendance 
- You are expected to have atleast 30% in assignments
- You are expected to have a 100% participation in final Project

(These requirements are subject to change. Any update will be duly communicated)

## Curriculum
We will primarily be using the three fantastic courses listed below as a source of reference. However, each volunteer course instructor has full autonomy in choosing which materials to use to teach their classes.

## Project
As a prerequisite for successfully concluding this cohort, participants are presented with two structural options based on prefrence. They may choose to engage in a collaborative group project or undertake an individual project. The primary objective of this initiative is to afford participants the opportunity to apply their theoretical knowledge gained throughout the cohort in a practical setting. Throughout the project engagement, participants will receive guidance from industry experts in Artificial Intelligence. These mentors will play a pivotal role in providing support and direction, ensuring the successful completion of the projects. Notably, there are currently 15 groups, each named after prominent African world leaders, symbolizing their significant contributions and advancements.
