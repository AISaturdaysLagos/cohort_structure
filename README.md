# cohort8_structure

## Overview
In this cohort, we utilize learning resources from the [practical data science course](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/lectures/), with the goal of solving a data science problem, starting from data collection to model inference. 

The cohort would last 16 weeks with 15 weeks of lectures and lab work and a break on week 9. We would select relevant lectures from the [practical data science course](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/lectures/), study them carefully and use the learned concepts in the labs.

There would be a series of labs, with each building up to a final solution to a chosen problem. For the labs, we have chosen to work on a fancy problem that involves reddit posts: 

 
> Given a reddit post, can you predict the subreddit to which it belongs? 

Working on these labs would expose us to the art of building a data science project from the ground up, starting from data collection and completing the process with a model for inference.

Additionally, participants are encouraged to work on a final project, exercising skills acquired from tinkering with the labs.
