# cohort8_structure

## Overview
In this cohort, we utilize learning resources from the [practical data science course](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/lectures/), with the goal of learning how to come up with practical solutions to data science problems, starting from data collection to model inference. 

The cohort would last 18 weeks with 17 weeks of lectures and 11 weeks of lab work and a break on week 10. We would select relevant lectures from the [practical data science course](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/lectures/), study them carefully and use the learned concepts in the labs. 

Additionally, participants are encouraged to work on a final project, exercising skills acquired from tinkering with the labs.
