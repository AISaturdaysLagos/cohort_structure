# cohort8_structure

# Introduction
For the past 7 cohorts (since January 6th 2018), we have offered free machine learning classes to more than 1000 Nigerians and we are excited to continue our long-standing tradition. This document will serve as a guideline for our students, as well as other communities looking to replicate the AI Saturdays Lagos model ‚ù§Ô∏è. Each cohort has a different flavor, so do check out our [Cohort 7](./cohort7/README.md) guideline as well.

## What should I expect?
- 17 weeks of Main class and 1 week break üòé
- 10 practicals 
- 1 Main project
- Exercises to put your knowledge to test
- Certificate of participation if all the requirements are fulfiled (more details below)

## How can I access the classes?
Our classes are streamed weekly and can be accessed online, at anytime - for free!

## It truly takes a village 
We are extremely grateful to our selfless volunteers - class and practical instructors, lab instructors, mentors, and many more. Our community is truly fortunate to have such an amazing, talented, kind, and incredible group of people ‚òòÔ∏è. 

Are you interested in joining our next cohort? Please follow us on [our various socials media platforms](https://ai6lagos.notion.site/Social-Media-Pages-78c3a6c29aa249c6b9a9579c1d02a53c) to keep in touch ‚ú®. 

If you wish to support our work and the initiatives we undertake, we kindly invite you to consider making a donation on our [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/aisaturdayslagos). Your generosity will play a crucial role in furthering our mission and helping us make a positive impact in the African AI community.

## Certificate Requirements
- You are expected to have about 60% or more participation in class.  Participation will be monitored by taking attendance 
- You are expected to have about 60% or more participation in Labs. Participation will be monitored by taking attendance 
- You are expected to have atleast 30% in assignments
- You are expected to have a 100% participation in final Project

(These requirements are subject to change. Any update will be duly communicated)

## Curriculum
We will primarily be using the three fantastic courses listed below as a source of reference. However, each volunteer course instructor has full autonomy in choosing which materials to use to teach their classes.

1. [CMU Data Science Course](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/lectures/) 
2. [Machine Learning @ VU University Amsterdam](https://mlvu.github.io/)
3. [Stanford Machine Learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-spring2021.html)
